## Contributing to Source Code

Thanks for wanting to contribute source code to ownCloud. That's great!

Before we're able to merge your code into the ownCloud app for Android, please, check the [contribution guidelines][contribution].

### Guidelines
* Contribute your code in a feature, fix, improvement or technical enhancement  branch by using  one of the following branch names:

     - ```feature/feature_name``` → new features in the app
     - ```fix/fix_name``` → fixing problems or bugs, always welcome!
     - ```improvement/improvement_name``` → make even better an existing feature
     - ```technical/technical_description```  → code review, DB... technical stuff improved

	Please, use the mentioned prefixes because CI system is ready to match with them. Be sure your feature, fix, improvement or technical branches are updated with latest changes in official `android/master`, it will give us a better chance to test your code before merging it with stable code.
* Once you are done with your code, start a pull request to merge your contribution into official `android/master`.
* Keep on using pull requests for your next contributions although you own write permissions.
* Important to mention that ownCloud Android team uses [GitFlow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) as branching model. Please take a look to the link to understand better what it is and how it works. It's something as useful as easy.

### 1. Fork and download android/master repository:

* Please follow [SETUP.md](https://github.com/owncloud/android/blob/master/SETUP.md) to setup ownCloud Android app work environment.

### 2. Create pull request:

NOTE: You must sign the [CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/owncloud/android) before your changes can be accepted!

* Create new feature, fix, improvement or technical enhancement branch from your master branch: ```git checkout -b feature/feature_name```
* Register your changes: git add filename
* Commit your changes locally: ```git commit -m "Brief description of the changes performed"```
* Push your changes to your GitHub repo: ```git push origin feature/feature_name```
* Browse to https://github.com/YOURGITHUBNAME/android/pulls and issue pull request
* Enter description and send pull request.

### 3. Update your contribution branch with master changes:

It is possible you see the next message from time to time.

<img src="docs_resources/out_of_date_branch.png" />

To fix this and make sure your contribution branch is updated with official android/master, you need to perform the next steps:
* Checkout your master branch: ```git checkout master```
* Get and apply official android/master branch changes in your master branch: ```git fetch upstream``` + ```git rebase upstream/master```. Now you have your master branch updated with official master branch changes.
* Checkout your contribution branch: ```git checkout feature/feature_name```
* Rebase contribution branch with master to put your contribution commits after the last commit of master branch, ensuring a clean commits history: ```git rebase master```. If there's some conflicts, solve it by using rebase in different steps.
* Push branch to server: ```git push -f origin feature/feature_name```. At this point, the message ```This branch is out-of-date with the base branch``` should disappear.
